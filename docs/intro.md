# Why spinach
I made spinach cause I the other quantum languages are not shaped like quantum comupting is.
The best forme is using python to describe circuits using tket and else. While python do the job quantum comupting still feels like a second class citisen with it cause it is.
Spinach's force is it's front end being shaped thinking about quantum computing.
A good example is the concept of a pipeline in Spinach. A function is code reusability. It's really usefull in classical computing but in quantum computing it feels odd. The reason is quantum has it's own problems that needs it's own features. The equivalent of a function with Spinach is a pipeline. It takes a qubit and passe it to different gates. The main difference is, a pipeline can be reversed. A lot of algorithms in quantum computing involves reversing effects by passing the qubit in the same gates again.

Spinach code is compatible with every quantum computers by compiling into their languages.
It can also be simulated with all the simulation libraries of python for the fact that, it is python under the hood.
