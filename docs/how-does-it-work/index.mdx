# how does it work?
This is a description of the compiler's flow.
<DotRenderer dot={graph} />
- The frontend parse the code using the grammar and create a CST.
- The CST is used to create an AST using the classes defined.
- The AST is used to create two transformers, one to check the maximum number of a qubit and a bit to initialise the circuit, the other to create the rest of the circuit.
- Both transformers are used to create the final tket circuit.

A tket circuit is extreamely versatile. From there we can compile to anything or even start simulations.

# grammar
Spinach is a LALR(1) grammar.
