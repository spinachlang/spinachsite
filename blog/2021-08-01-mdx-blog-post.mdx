# 🚀 Transition from a Personal to a Community Project

Spinach began as a personal experiment, but over time I realized its potential to grow into a true **community-driven project**.  
To make this happen, I’d love your support.

## 🔬 A Call for Quantum Computing Feedback

<Details>
  <summary>👩‍🔬 Why Quantum Feedback Matters</summary>

Spinach isn’t just another programming language—it’s designed with **quantum computing in mind**.  
If you’ve worked with quantum computers before, your insights can help ensure that Spinach:

- Feels natural for quantum workflows  
- Avoids common pitfalls of "shoehorning" quantum into classical paradigms  
- Builds concepts (like pipelines) that match real-world usage
